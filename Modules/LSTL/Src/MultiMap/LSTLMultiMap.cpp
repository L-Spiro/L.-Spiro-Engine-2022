 * Description: An associative container in which multiple values may share the same keys.  This similar to
 *	CLinearMap, except that a CLinearMap allows only one key/value pair.  A multimap supports key/[value/value/value/...]
 *	associations.
 *
 * Because keys are sorted, the key type must implement the == and < operators.
